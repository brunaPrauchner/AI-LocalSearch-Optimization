<h2>Conference Schedule Optimization:</h2>
This application seeks to minimize wasted time at a conference, using genetic algorithm developed in Java.


<h2>Problem Description:</h2>
In the schedule of a scientific conference there is a set of presentations (also called events), of which only a few will be accepted at  the conference. The auditorium is open for 12 hours straight, this limit cannot be exceeded.
The user registers the conference events and informs the duration of each one. The goal is to put as many events as possible on the schedule and discover the best order for presentation of each one.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
One of the main advantages comes from the operation "crossover", which consists of an ability to combine large blocks of letters that have evolved independently to perform useful functions. It was also noticed that this problem presented in the article is very simple, but useful. The problem may have bigger challenges when being implemented, if you add more than one day of operation auditorium, or the articles are separated by category, among other difficulties that can be added.
